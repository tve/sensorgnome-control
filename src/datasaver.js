/*

  DataSaver.js - provide file-based writeableStreams to clients who
  can then save data to them.  Deal with generating correct filenames
  on appropriate drives.

  Required globals: GPS, Deployment, Machine

FIXME: output streams should use output files, not fs.fileWriteSTreams,
so we can detect how many bytes short we are on a write, and resend
once the file stream is re-opened on another disk.  Currently, we'll
lose one chunk of data (probably less than a second) when writing a .wav
to the end of one disk and continuing on another.

   Data File Nomenclature and Placement
   ====================================

   SGdata/BOOT_COUNT/YYYY-MM-DD/DEPLOYMENT_CODE-MACHINE_ID-BOOT_COUNT-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.SSSSC-SRC.EXT

   - DEPLOYMENT_CODE is short user string containing no "-" (any "-" are replaced by "_")

   - MACHINE_ID is the 12 unique beaglebone/rpi id (/etc/sensorgnome_id)

   - BOOT_COUNT is zero-padded 6-digit boot count

   - timestamp is precise to 0.1 ms and is UTC; (YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.SSSS)

   - timestamp code (C) is
      - Z: timestamp was obtained after the GPS set the clock, so should be good
      - P: timestamp was obtained before the GPS set the clock, so may be very wonky
      - A: timestamp was obtained before the GPS set the clock, but corrected post-hoc (and so is approximately correct)

   - SRC is a USB port number, for raw .wav data files; otherwise, it is a string from
     this list:
      - "all": output from every plugin on every port; the first item in each output line
        should be the port identifier (e.g. "p1", "p2", ...)

   - EXT is a file extension:
     .txt - for temporary ascii file written as data are available
     .txt.gz - for compressed .dat file; after writing, we delete the original .txt
     .wav - for raw audio

   - the "SGdata" folder is created in the first (alphabetically) directory in /media for which
     the corresponding drive has at least 1M available.  Directories in /media have these names:

     /media/disk_port1-1      disk in USB port 1, partition 1
     /media/disk_port1-2      disk in USB port 1, partition 2
     ...
     /media/disk_port2-1      disk in USB port 2, partition 1
     ...
     /media/SD_card           micro SD card
